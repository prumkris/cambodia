                <h1>Angkor Wat</h1>
                <p>Angkor Wat is the largest religious monument in the world, located in Siem Reap, Cambodia. Built in the early 12th century by King Suryavarman II, it was originally dedicated to the Hindu god Vishnu. Over time, it gradually transformed into a Buddhist temple and remains a major place of worship today. The temple is known for its grand scale, harmonious architecture, and detailed carvings that depict Hindu epics such as the Ramayana and Mahabharata.</p>

                <h1>Angkor Bayon</h1>
                <p>Angkor Bayon, also known as the Bayon Temple, is a richly decorated Khmer temple located at the center of Angkor Thom, the ancient royal city built by King Jayavarman VII in the late 12th century. Unlike the orderly layout of Angkor Wat, Bayon is known for its unique design featuring 54 towers, each adorned with large, serene faces carved in stoneâ€”totaling over 200 smiling faces. These faces are believed to represent either the king himself or the bodhisattva of compassion, Avalokiteshvara.</p>
